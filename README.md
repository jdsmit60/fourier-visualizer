# fourier-visualizer
A tool for visualization of Fourier series

I created this tool at first out of curiosity and out of frustration that the web app
Desmos was so slow for the kind of graphs I and my mentors were trying to generate.

Later the project became my official component of an honors project for my PHY 121
class in the Spring of 2017.
